The see package complements these numeric summaries with a host of functions and tools to produce a range of publication-ready visualizations for model parameters, predictions, and performance diagnostics. As a core pillar of easystats, the see package helps users to utilize visualization for more informative, communicable, and well-rounded scientific reporting.},
